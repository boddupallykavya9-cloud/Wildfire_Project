## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/wildfire-detection.git
cd wildfire-detection

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

python -m venv wildfire_env

### Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment

**Windows (PowerShell):**

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\wildfire_env\Scripts\Activate.ps1

**Windows (CMD):**
wildfire_env\Scripts\activate

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Step 4: Run the Streamlit App

streamlit run app.py

The application will open in your browser at:  
👉 http://localhost:8501

## 🔥 Features
- Upload an image and detect **Wildfire / No Wildfire**
- Deep Learning-based CNN classifier
- Interactive Streamlit web interface
- Scalable for real-time alert integration
- Clean and modular project structure

---

## 🧪 Model Training (Optional)
To retrain the model using your own dataset:

python train.py
The trained model will be saved locally as an .h5 file 

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- The dataset is intentionally excluded from this repository
- `wildfire_env/` is a local virtual environment and must not be uploaded to GitHub
- Large model files can be excluded if size limits are exceeded
